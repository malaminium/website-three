      <b>artistic intent</b>
      <div  id="maniTog"> everything all at once always. there is no divide between art and artist. action is artistic, and art is based in action. the greatest action to take is action itself.</div>
      <b>what digital art demands</b>
      <div id="maniTog">
            the efficiency that the internet affords its users is limiting in an artisitc sense in that it does its best to eliminate the process of failure and art that has no function. the desire exists to create art that simultaiously presents itself exclusively on a digital platform while being less comprehensive and accessable than if it had existed in a physical medium. what could this be? cooking can only exist in the reality. knitting can only exist in the reality. zines...
          </div>
      <b>on the nature of zines in relation to digital art</b>
      <div  id="maniTog"> test</div>
      <b>on desperation</b>
      <div  id="maniTog"> which is to say, there’s no desperation without hope for a better day. desperation is proof that a better life is possible. scrap on the ground, blood in the dirt, dirt in the bloodstream. anything goes, everything has to go. 
        what am i desperate for? not approval or acceptance. not recognition, but instead to make everything that i can think of. there’s a deadline, i just can’t see it yet. there’s so much work to be done.
        </div>
        <b>on depth</b>
      <div  id="maniTog"> i want to do everything. i want to perform on stage i want to play the guitar i want to write albums i want to do what i can’t do perfectly, perfectly. i want to be a maker with my hands i want to keep making things forever. i want to make something every single day. i want my life to be an art project that keeps growing. how does this work? if i pick a broad enough theme, then make within the theme, then everything is interconnected. possible themes: proof of life. maximalism. present existence. proof of life. absurdism. self-expression. self definition. collapsing individuality. desperation. reckless desperation.</div>
      <b>on the future</b>
      <div  id="maniTog"> I dont like the ideas that … “for now”, in regards to AI and technology’s capabilities. It’s more important to assume that AI and technology can take creative actions, can pass the Turing test, can do everything we assume that it might be able to do in the future. In this way, artists can start responding to the reality of the present.</div>

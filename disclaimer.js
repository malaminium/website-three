/*theres a styles.css file that i use, while at the same time having a styles tag in the html of some of the pages. this is sloppy, in my opinion. the explanation that i have is that i made the styles.css file first, and then found out that you could use a styles tag. i decided that the less efficient one was easier to use, and so that's the one that im using...lame...

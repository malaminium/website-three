      ANTONIO, WHO PRETENDS TO BE SOMEONE ELSE
Max Chu


CHARACTER DESCRIPTION
ANTONIO - devoted to the acting he does, but not the reason why he does it. Motivated by a love of the craft, but moreso by the increase in that capital, baybee!
VINCENZO VALENTINO- dying, poetic Italian. Rambles often and speaks slowly. Sweet. Italian Accent.
JENNA LANGHTREE - midwestern, very polite but has more traditional values. Earlier stages of memory loss. Southern Accent.
GORDON GRANT - old bachelor, made his fortune in predicting that the tech bubble would collapse, but at that point he was already pretty old, so there was little chance to use it. Libertarian, though. Cheesy Transatlantic Accent (if possible).
PETUNIA WHITTAKER - a mother, jaded, but spry when need be, despite her withered stature. More aware of her situation than many of the others. No accent
CHARLIE - nurse, morally against what ANTONIO does for a living, and very obnoxious about reminding Tony just of this fact. Doesn’t think that the patients should be kept in the dark. Losing his Brooklyn accent
NURSE - helps the elderly characters off and on the stage into the chair.


At rise, VINCENZO is seated in a comfortable chair, centerstage. ANTONIO is seated at VINCENZO’s side in a less comfortable chair. NURSE stand dutifully to VINCENZO’s other side. VINCENZO has been speaking, but he speaks slowly, and with a wheeze-y cadence. Lights up:


VINCENZO
You’ve been so sweet to me in these past days, and dare I say it some of my last! At the end, you can feel death coming, feel the cosmic strings pulling you back into the void; now that’s not something everyone tells you! (Beat) It’s best to go peacefully, I’ve decided, and I knew a poem about this once...it went “go into a peaceful night,” but that doesn’t sound right, does it? Oh, I can’t remember...I can’t remember…(Beat) who did you say you were again?


ANTONIO
I’m your son: Roberto.


VINCENZO
Ah, yes, yes, Roberto. I must tell you, Roberto, that I have very few regrets in life–just one, that I can remember these days...and that is-


ANTONIO
What is it, father?


VINCENZO
Quiet, boy, let me remember. (Beat) Ah yes, yes.


From under his blanket, VINCENZO takes out a yogurt cup or some type of trash.


VINCENZO
My greatest possession, my son. I give it to you now in the hopes that you will return to Italy so that you might place it on the grave of your mother. This is my final wish, whisps from the lips of a dying man. She lies buried just outside of Florence, in the courtyard of the Church of Saint Lucia, under the large Gnicche Holy Oak. Most everything I have forgotten, but never where my dear Beatrice lies waiting. Do this for me, my son, so I might pass on in peace.


ANTONIO
Of course, father. It is your dying wish after all.


VINCENZO
Good, good. Good… 


VINCENZO begins to space out. NURSE walks in and helps him up and off stage. ANTONIO gets up and walks to the other end of the stage, where he meets CHARLIE, clipboard in hand, dress over shoulder.


CHARLIE
Ey Tony, how’s the biz? Lyin’ to them poor old folks still paying well?


ANTONIO
(barely interested)
Yeah, yeah, making the green, you can step off it. (ANTONIO throws the yogurt cup into the trashcan at the edge of the stage) Who do I got up next?


CHARLIE
(Ignoring the question, sarcastic)
Yeah, it’s real sweet whatcha do, pretending to be someone’s son or daughter and gettin their hopes up after they stop coming around. You must sleep real well!


ANTONIO
Sure do. But I still gotta go to my next client, who is… (Gestures)


CHARLIE
Oh of course, how could I forget. Name of da lady up next is Jenna Langhtree. Admitted six months ago, grew up and lived her life in the midwest, out in horse country. Southern draw typa accent, you know? You are going to play her daughter, Sammy Langhtree


ANTONIO
Wait, daughter? 


CHARLIE
Yeah, (tosses him the dress of his shoulder) you’ll look great, Tony.  


ANTONIO
What about Patrice? Why can’t she do it?


CHARLIE
Oh, you didn’t hear? Got in a fight with a horse.


ANTONIO
God, what? Is she okay?


CHARLIE
Oh, she’s fine, but you should have seen the horse! Looked so bad, the farmer sued, and now she’s in deep shit with some lawyer guy–might go to jail. 


ANTONIO
Huh, wonder what the horse did to deserve it. (Contemplative Beat) Anyway, what’s this next lady like?


CHARLIE
She’s sweet, Tony, so don’t fuck this up. Worked as a tailor for most all of her life. Try sayin’ “ma” I think.


ANTONIO
(Putting on the dress)
“Ma...Ma…”


With the dress on, ANTONIO walks back to centerstage, where LANGHTREE now sits in the chair. ANTONIO changes his voice.


ANTONIO 
Ma, how are you feeling? Are you doing alright here?


MS. LANGHTREE 
(Unsure) 
Who...who are you? You’re not my daughter…


ANTONIO looks at the nurse, subtly annoyed.


NURSE 
Of course she is, Ms. Langhtree


ANTONIO
Ma, I’m right here, it’s me. Don’t you remember Christmas, with Pa and the big trees he would always get?


MS. LANGHTREE
Oh, I’m not so sure. You’re my daughter? You’re my Sammy?


ANTONIO
You remember! That’s me, I’m Sammy!


MS. LANGHTREE
(Confident now) 
Oh Sammy, look how much you’ve changed! You’re so tall now, have you found yourself a husband yet?


ANTONIO
Not quite yet, but Ma, I’m almost there! Jackson proposed to me this week, and I just had to come tell you!


MS. LANGHTREE
Hurrah hurray! (peeters off, tired) Is he the one who wanted to be a minister, or is he the prostitute?


ANTONIO 
(taken aback) 
Ah… he’s, he’s a new one. He likes to take pictures, and he works on the computer.


MS. LANGHTREE 
Computers, huh… well, that makes me so happy, when are you getting married?


ANTONIO 
Well it’s at the beginning of summer…  


MS. LANGHTREE
Oh is it? So faraway… 


NURSE 
Oh Ms. Langhtree, it’s time for your evening check-up. We should go.


MS. LANGHTREE
Oh already? Okay, well, Sammy you’ll come back, won’t you?


ANTONIO
Of course, ma, and maybe next time I can bring some of Jackson’s pictures for you to see?


MS. LANGHTREE
Pictures, huh… that...that sounds nice.


ANTONIO
(softly) 
Goodbye ma, love you!


MS. LANGHTREE 
(oblivious, instead addressing the NURSE while moving offstage) 
Did you hear that? My baby Sammy is getting married! 


ANTONIO gets up and takes the dress off as soon as MS. LANGHTREE is offstage, drops a big sigh.  CHARLIE walks in and takes the dress, rudely presented to him by ANTONIO.


ANTONIO
Charlie-boy, write down under patient L to bring pictures next time. (Beat, CHARLIE writes) You know, on second thought cross it off, what does it matter? (CHARLIE crosses it out, annoyed)


Who’s up on the chopping block next?


CHARLIE
Looks like you really hate this job, huh? The scheming and shit really gets to you; who knew?


ANTONIO
Jesus Fucking Christ just tell me who’s next?


CHARLIE
Calm down Tony, just makin’ a little observation is all... 


ANTONIO
Hey this is my 9 to 5 too–it ain’t a charity service. I’m workin’ just as much as the next dentist ‘er cop ‘er...horse farmer. Honestly, I could care less whether I was lyin’ to these people or telling them they got two months, as long as I’m getting paid I’m coming in! Lay off and tell me who my next patient is.


CHARLIE
(More curt) 
Fuck, Tony, all right. Name’s Gordon Grant, been here for two years now. Used to be some big shot stock market shark, but retired in 1999 when he made a buncha money somehow. There’s not much else here, but he looks pretty far gone at this point.


ANTONIO
Splendid. Thank you Charlie.


Exit CHARLIE stage left, enter GORDON stage right, helped on by NURSE, who is especially tender. Approach ANTONIO


GORDON
Who are you?! Are you from the bank?


ANTONIO
Uh, yeah… yes I’m from the bank to talk to about your… uhm, retirement… accounts. Yeah.


GORDON
Retirement accounts? I got none of them! You 


ANTONIO
(Desperately) 
No no, sure I’m from the bank, and sure I'm SUPPOSED to be here to collect your money, but truly sir, I hate them as much as you do


GORDON
You do, huh? Then why ya here?


ANTONIO
I uh, I just uh, I wanna get out. Get out of the banks and uh…-


GORDON
And you heard about me huh? You lookin for some advice from the big man of the bubble?


ANTONIO
Yeah, yeah, I’m here to get some advice.


GORDON
(ANTONIO becomes progressively more invested) 
Good on you boy, good on you. I’ve made a whole lot of money. They called me the bubble man on wall street, the bull of the bubble because… ah, because, well I can’t quite remember that now, but let me tell you that the banks are no good, take it from me! You can never trust a liberal; All my assets, and I mean all of them are separate from the system-I got gold buried on the ranch, I got twelve lean hogs, guaranteed! to go up in value in the next seven quarters, a buddy a while back gifted me some beautiful, profitable stallions, horses-


ANTONIO
What’s that? Horses? Really horses?


GORDON
People go crazy over ‘em, they’re like shitting gold mines.


ANTONIO
Horses, maybe I should get into ‘em


GORDON
They’re expensive startin’ out, but you can make big profit, big big profit. (Beat to consider the big profit) You know what kid, I like your story. Tryna escape the big banks, tryna go down the path of big money, reminds me of my childhood-


ANTONIO
I’m tryin’ my best,


GORDON
No, don’t interrupt me, listen to this: horses are expensive. Economic freedom is expensive. What I got here, for you, is one of the best investments one can make (Pulls out gold coin from his many layers of clothes) Gold. Never fails. And it’s ah.. It’s (Hesitates)


ANTONIO
It’s what, old man?!


GORDON
(Glassy eyed, too lost in thought) 
I never had a son. Dozens of daughters, dozens of dames, but never a son. I give you this coin so you can be free; of whatever holds you down. Escape the bank my boy. Be somethin, bigger than yourself. (Hands ANTONIO the gold coin)


ANTONIO
‘course. I’ll buy some horses. Make you proud.


GORDON
Good good, I’m glad. Thank you, my son. (Tries to stand, falls a bit. NURSE jumps in to help him up) It’s time for me to head home, go watch my Dave Ramsey. 


NURSE leads GORDON offstage. CHARLIE enters again


ANTONIO
(holding up the coin) 
Look, Charlie my boy, finally something good to come out of this job. I’m eatin’ well tonight!


CHARLIE
Tony, you got one more ‘fore you can go.


ANTONIO
(rolls eyes) 
Ah you gotta be shittin’ me Charlie, you serious?


CHARLIE
(Beat, they look at each other hard) 
Look, fuckin do it or don’t for all I care, you know where I stand. But if all you’re in it for is the money, then why do you even fuckin stay here? If I were you, I’d fuck all and— 
(...tell these people the truth that their families can’t stand them...)


ANTONIO
Jesus, I don’t have to listen to this again!


ANTONIO grabs the clipboard out of CHARLIE’s hands, reads it, and then throws it offstage. CHARLIE runs after it


CHARLIE
(while running) 
Fuck you!


ANTONIO takes a few breaths, then turns around, and meets PETUNIA in the chair.


ANTONIO
Hello, Petunia, I am your son–do you remember me?


PETUNIA
(confident) 
No, no you’re not. (TONY glances at the NURSE, tired and annoyed)


NURSE
Of course he is, Ms. Whittaker


PETUNIA[a]
No, he’s not; I know my son. I know he smells of lavender, and like coffee creamer. I know my son has crinkles around his eyes and a nose piercing I don’t approve of; I know I love my son, and I do not love you. (Aside) If only I could remember his name. 


ANTONIO
(Beat, then tired) 
Alright miss, you got me. I work for the hospital. Name’s Antonio


PETUNIA
Antonio. What are you doing here impersonating my son?


ANTONIO
I’m here...well...I’m here to make you feel better—or so it says in my contract. 


PETUNIA
The hospital hires you to pretend to be someone else? That’s cruel


ANTONIO
(frustrated breath, then patient yet condescending) 
There are many people here, just like you, who really benefit from this memory work 


PETUNIA
Work! Is that it? Is that all you see this as? We’re people, Antonio, and we deserve to be treated as such.


ANTONIO
(getting up)
I don’t have to answer to you–


PETUNIA
Don’t run away–sit with me.Do your job and make me feel better; give an old woman some company. (ANTONIO sits back down. Awkward beat) I’m sorry, I’m being ferocious. Its frustrating for me, too, watching things fade away. It’s like everyday trying to catch a fly sometimes you’ll open your hand and they’ll be a little black spot in the middle of your palm, but mostly it’s nothing; There’s nothing. (Beat) There’s one more thing you should know about my son. He’s dead.


ANTONIO
Oh, miss, I’m...I apologize


PETUNIA
There are days that I forget, of course. I woke up this morning and read that he was dead, from off my arm. I must read it every morning, and write it every night.
 
ANTONIO
Doesn’t that hurt?


PETUNIA
Oh, it’s just sharpie


ANTONIO
But when you wake up every morning, doesn’t it hurt to know again and again that your son is… has passed on? Why do you do it?


PETUNIA
I can’t tell you about yesterday, but this morning I cried. It was devastating, I know that I was devastated. And I’m sure that I was devastated too, yesterday. And sure, I thought about why I might choose to do this to myself, too, but imagine being forgotten. And then he’s really dead, and then so I’ll be really be dead and I’m not sure I could live with that, you know? (She laughs) He lives on as long as I’m around to remember him. That’s how it is, and since I don’t know if I’m ready to let him go, now I’ll write again that my son died on my arm. (Half-beat) If you’ll excuse me, I need to go before I forget. Thank you for entertaining me, and helping me remember (P gets up and begins to walk away)


ANTONIO
Petunia, before you go…


PETUNIA
Yes?


ANTONIO
His name was James. It said it on the file before I came in. Let me, uh, let me write it on your arm, so you remember.


ANTONIO takes out a sharpie and writes the name on PETUNIA’s arm, however big.


PETUNIA
Thank you, Antonio. Take care of yourself


PETUNIA leaves, arm in arm with the NURSE. ANTONIO gets up and walks slowly towards the trash can, where he runs into CHARLIE


CHARLIE
Okay Tony, you’re done. Get outta here.


Beat, where ANTONIO and CHARLIE have a more sincere moment of eye contact until ANTONIO looks down into the trash can. He notices the yogurt cup, and picks it back up.


ANTONIO
I think I’m going to take a couple days off coming up. Go on vacation. Decompress. You know, Charlie, this job really gets to you sometimes. Makes ya say things you don’t mean too much.


CHARLIE rolls his eyes.


CHARLIE
Whatever man, good for you. –Where you gonna go?


ANTONIO
I heard from a patient that Florence ain’t too bad around this time a year. (Looks at yogurt cup)


CHARLIE
Sounds nice, Tony. 


ANTONIO
I hope so. (Begins to leave) I’ll see ya around sometime, hu Charlie. And if you see Patrice around, tell her not to worry: I hear horses are in right now.


Exit ANTONIO.


END PLAY.
[a]the memoriy is triggered by her accidentally reading her arm, insteaad of already having the knowledge. her soid exterior is broken briefly, but throughoutly, and she falls into tonys arms for a moment until her composure revives and she sits up again. To that she pretends it never happened, and goes into her monologue about memory which will convince antonio to give a shit about shit

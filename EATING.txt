ACKNOWLEDGMENTS






First and foremost, I have to thank Heather Woodward, without whom I would know very little. Through her incredible passion and patience, I feel I have the knowledge to truly call myself a writer. I have to thank my parents, Dickson and Kristin Chu, for their understanding, perspective, and every ride to school and back, early and late. I’d like to thank Ploi Pirapokin, for always expressing her opinion towards the further improvement of my thesis, and thank the infinitely inspiring artists-in-residence that have come and gone in my time at SoTA. Finally, I have the privilege to thank my fellow seniors. There are no words to express my gratitude towards you all.

Eating Life Whole Before It Goes


The stove is hot, the oil bites
The pan is steaming under the lights and smells
Like it’s time for dinner
________________
An Elegy For Pomegranates


Pomegranates is seeds, is red
dripping down sides, is bound
to lose in the end. My thumbs


dig deep in the membrane and
tear it away with ease. I imagine
the digging is palpable and 
screeching.


Pomegranate is enjoyed best
peeled underwater. Where it is
ripped and torn easy––
without staining a cutting
board or counter. The kernels


fall away with
little coaxing. Pomegranate
is hollow, is wind
rustling in the trees,
is the bitter bite
of winter in the nights.
Is fragile.


Torn open
an earthquake,
and for what? For who?
To sit around like red on cheeks?
I see red on cheeks


Pomegranate falls
to the sink like two
halves of a coconut.


Next day, instead of rain
falls seeds. They blister
They blister the ground,


in enormous
sizes. As big as dogs. Blocks
are torn away,


all that bark is red. I’ve 
been struggling to keep a hold of anything these days. I 
can’t write like this,
with this red on my hands. 
________________
An Elegy For Salts


Is passion enough?


Salt licks the wound
blue, black, slowly,
so that the bruise takes months
to breach a way
to the surface. Bastardous


hole in the body, while
the bruise sticks
around, as though
sweetness has gone out to lunch––
stuck to honeysuckle,
is salt the opposite of love?


Among the murk of
the shallow bottom dead
sea, there’s a pure passion
fruit, passionately.
It doesn’t know where it is.
Saltwater might
Overtake those bowed branches,
eat away bark, ravenously.


The bruise grows, 
and the skin is soaking in 
salt water. Maybe
some foregin object might
be drawn out of the skin, some
thing wormed its way under the folds of this
withered and dry world around it.
________________
An Elegy For Meats


The only compliment you ever paid me
was that I had a “killer” left
hook, and I spent weeks trying to seperate


the violence of the comment from
that what made me love
you, but I couldn’t. I can
see fats in your eyes, like the white


stroke across the steak in front of me.
By the end of dinner, what I’ve abandoned,
I spot you glancing at until finally
you skewer the fat off my


plate and eat it without much 
of the hullabaloo I thought it was going to be.
You pat your belly and say “this
is what makes me such a good boxer.”


If you had a black eye
now, you would look like a panda
bear. You already have a black jacket
and cellophane skin, hematoma and violet


pools. I prick myself with the steak knife instead,
and thank you for dinner before leaving.
Tomorrow, the cut will rip itself open
under my glove. Once, I said


it was all going to become too much.
In your basement,
you have a flank of beef hanging.
off a hook in your freezer,


there’s a plastic snapper full of bacon fat, 
and on your countertop
sits an Iberian ham like an orange bust.
On your permanent record,


there’s a misdemeanor of assault
for punching
someone in the locker room. You
said “the only difference between


then and twenty minutes before then
was a pair of gloves” and “everyone 
got mad for no reason.” you had a greed for absolutes
like those, and these days, I find myself


agreeing with you more often. “That was just taken
out of context,” I say. And these
days, I find that 
everything’s in the ring with you.


Meat always ends in a fight.
I never noticed the violence
of “breaking” in “breaking
up” until we came


face to face; how much 
“breaking” felt like everything
else in my life. I edged you
in the doorway, and drove off.


Knives were dull,
forks were dull, a frozen pizza
dinner that would never
heat up and still,


I was pulling pepperoni out of my mouth like they were hairs:
They tasted rotted through.
Something had to change.


I would say
“Having to consider mortality at every meal has become
exhausting––I’d like to have that time for myself again, if that’s okay.”
He asked me
“Aren’t you afraid that I’m going to be stronger
than you.”
________________
There is a dying coyote in your front yard. You have two opportunities before you. You could nurse it back to health. Though this is one of the opportunities, do not follow this path, as similar to any time two options are presented, there is always a right choice and a horrifically wrong choice. The other option is to kill the coyote and prepare it to be eaten. There’s no way of truly understanding the advantages of either path, but you’ve clearly dealt with worse considering. For now though, allow me to present
TWENTY-FIVE WAYS TO REDISCOVER THE THRILL OF COOKING


ONE: Consider The Wind & Leaves Exiled From The Trees
 The dog whimpers at the foot of death, and suddenly you stand before it with the killing thing in hand. That stone, it already drips red. There is no rush like this. In the wild, there is nothing like this.


TWO: Throw A Rock At The Coyote From A Distance
        If it still moves, do it again. Then, go to church.


THREE: Consider The Plants Growing In The Underbrush
        They are along the dusty path you take to get home. Poke your head over the plants and see the brambles growing in the dusty creekbed. Now that your status has changed from a simple casual eater to professional chef, so must have your perspective on the world, right?


FOUR: All The Greenery That Spring Presents
        Suddenly, this greenery is not just flora––you no longer just see the simple shrub, stick or silt. Instead, you see something much more valuable: Ingredients. Be excited!


FIVE: Your Shirt Will Have To Do
        Since you rushed out of the house so hastily, you’ve forgotten the normal wicker basket and under normal circumstances, aromatics leak out of ingredients if your wicker woven basket isn’t used.  


SIX: Pick The Grass
        Drag the dirt from the ground and fill your shirt with the soil like you’re oiling a skillet. For now, edibility is not the motive here; quantity is. Aim to pick anything garish and vibrant especially.


SEVEN: Try And Let The Water Drain Away
        When you return home, put your ingredients in the sink and wash them as best you can. Use your hands to acquaint yourself with the greens, and for a moment, let your fingers be long and wrap around what is yours.


EIGHT: When You Find The Rat
        In the unlikely chance that you encounter some small mammal, leave them in. Remember, down the second path, life is no longer a race and things such as mortality and humanity have been left behind. Time to put on a new shirt.


NINE: Return To The Body
        Give the now deceased (as we will use the word deceased to denote respect for an equal) a name, and dig it a grave. A name that’s something particularly sweet and canine might be best. Something distant from human. Dig the boy a grave and carve it a headstone. This is the trickiest step, and this is the one which is indicative of whether or not you are emotionally mature enough to take on the role of chef, because you’re going to be looking at this dead thing for sixteen more reasons.


TEN: Grieve (Optional)
        Try and spend time for the soul which you did not, could not, and will never know. Now is the time to send letters to the next-of-kin.


ELEVEN: Into The Kitchen
        Drag the dead thing up your steps and across your foyer. If it leaves blood and dirty things on the carpet, good. You are proudly a testament to your actions now, and only god can judge you.


TWELVE: Skin The Thing
        You have many knives to choose from, dug out from a sacred secondhand store, or left behind when your boyfriend moved out. Which knife to use isn’t going to be immediately obvious, since this is your first time skinning a dead coyote, so lay your hand over each. In this way, the correct knife will make itself known as the one hot and determined.


THIRTEEN: Remove The Head
        Knife in hand, approach the head. This is where the bashing took place, and so you must remove it, and anyways it isn’t good to eat some other mammal’s brain, else they have nothing to think about when they’re dead. What makes you so great that you deserve two brains.


FOURTEEN: There’s More Sawing Than You Anticipated
        Break into a sweat, left hand on right hand and drag the knife along the lines of muscle running down the dog’s back. A single centimeter is a battle, and if it weren’t you then you wouldn’t be deserving of the position you were in. When life pushes back against you, this is the path on which you are meant to be on. The struggle is part of the reward.


FIFTEEN: Carving Is Intuition
        Soon, you’ll lose yourself in the preparation, and look back to find that what used to be a coyote is now neatly divided into meat and bones. What was whole is now just parts.


SIXTEEN: With The Bones
        There is no advice here for what to do with the bones. Bones hold power, and since you’re so incredibly intimate with them already, you have to do something. What that is, we can’t say. Perhaps carve them into instruments.


SEVENTEEN: On Focusing
        Ritual is repetition, and so perfection only exists in the next iteration. It’s easy to get caught up in what might the next hours look like, that you lose yourself outside of the corpse in front of you. Instead, drop the formalities and know that since you’re in for a penny, out for a pound, you better start collecting.


EIGHTEEN: Finally, Enter The Meats
        Coyote is lean, lots of muscle with a small amount of fat. What this means is that you want the meat to be in the heat for as little time as possible in order to spare as much of the delicious fat as possible. A stew is no good, unless you’re willing to dilute the meat with lots of other fattier or oilier elements.


NINETEEN: Searing
        The only good way to cook what you’ve been given is searing. Pull down a cast iron from its hook above. Light a fire on your stove, cut butter into the pan. It will froth and spin until it is soupy. You are on the verge of the poetic resolution you’ve been searching for this whole time.


TWENTY: Once The Butter Browns
        Wait for the kitchen to smell of sparkling fat. The breeze will drag in the smell of bay and sage from the wilderness outside. Wait on this small window of smells, and then jump into action.


TWENTY ONE: The Meat Crackles In The Pan
        If you listen close enough, you might here some mercies, some forgiveness from the once coyote. Remember that it is no longer a coyote, and so does not know what it’s saying. Look instead for the meat to brown around the edges. Season the bare side, sprinkle salt and pepper, garishly rip thyme from its stem. Put your finger on the back of the steak, now dressed. It’s still cold, the heat hasn’t yet made its way through the meat to the other side. Something humane still rests here, some memory of a winter. Flip the steak now.


TWENTY TWO: The Unrecognizable Backside
        If you wait, you can touch this side, too. You suspect it might feel like summer, but there’s no easy parallel here. Scored and shriveled and brown, there are no remnants of what you once knew.


TWENTY THREE: What You Once Knew
        Once, you knew about steaks. Once, you knew the cookbooks in your kitchen like scripture. Once, you loved something so wild and animal that you had no choice but to draw rocks from the garden. Once, you knew about a departure.


TWENTY FOUR: Before Removing The Meat
        Tilt the pan on its side. If you used enough butter, now here will be a remnant of the blood and iron and butter and spices you used before. There’s a pool that’s created here, and you can see a rainbow in the skim. Scoop this mixture up and use it to baste the meat. Then, turn up the heat by turning up the heat and searing quickly either side of the steak, where the flames hadn't quite reached. Blacken them, if you like.


TWENTY FIVE: Plate The Thing
        Now you’ve played god, and perhaps you’ve finally found that its loneliness is inescapable. How you eat the thing is not for us to say, as what you’ve done is reproachable. What once moved and loved and survived is now dead by your hands.

City Boy


City boy, where do you fall
               where do you wade?
City boy, does the cement get to you
               does the sentimentality ever get the best of you?
City boy, when you go to Ocean Beach at 8pm
              and strip to the nude
              when one foot drags the other
              raw in the sand’s grain
              when your fingers turn blue,
        Know that to feel love is to feel warmth in your body
                                                     in your antibodies boldy fighting a cold
        So wade in the icy tide, City boy,
              Drowning in the cold and dipping in the blue


City boy, as though saturn has supercollided in your eyes, you’re blind to
             who loves you most but your very own blood in your body
                That’s why you bite the city mouse in two,
                score its ribs with your teeth and swallow its liver
                that’s why you wade in the icy tide lover
City boy, where are you lost
             where are you scored?
City boy, how is it, when you gargle the ocean in your lungs, that you care to speak still
             how jellyfish float in your throat and barnacles sprout from your cracked lips


City boy, what loves you standing nude in the mirror,
     robbed, red, dirty lunged and voice like an avalanche
City boy, where your hair’s slicked back and dripping
             where your belly is lumped and rancid and boundless at once
             where your nails are yellow and perfectly geometrically twisting
             where your cheeks are two blue bruises


        You’re Gothic, City boy

Climate Collapse


I have so few memories, and yet I can’t remember which is first. The time in my head is refracted like light off my amygdala, hippocampus, and out through my ears in green and red fractals like a holiday car sale. My mind dilates at the thought of childhood self. I zap around the old house like a lightning apirition. Was watching the TV with my aunt my first memory? Was playing on a wool alphabet carpet with the young Satoro my first memory? Was it stealing the ferrero rochers off my father’s desk while he wasn’t looking? They all could have been the same day. In my mind they are. 


In the old house, tigers wander in from the zoo. They curl up on the cool marble countertop, while the backyard has turned to a concrete enclosure. Polar bear, she walks along the edge of the garden fence, light as a leaf, dipping her toe in the water. Little amusement park rocketships topple over paintings of ancestors and who comes down the steps but my grandmother, years passed and suddenly, it’s moving day. So there were two days in the old house, not just one.


Another house like a set springs to mind, in pinecrest. Back and forth rocks a faceless godfather, who died of cancer quickly, relative to my timeline. Looking back, my first memory is struggling to remember his face.


What will we remember, down the nuclear line? Or is nuclear too dated? We’re on the ultraviolet, ultraviolent line now, and end-of-the-line is in a great monsoon sweeping up life, but the train makes one stop before hell in Pismo Beach, California. Off we get to piss and drink and drug and make a whole mess of the last hour we got before God drops a hot one on us. When we’re melting away into soup, will our last memory be of Yosemite Valley? WIll it be of the Marin Headlands or Tennessee Valley or the geysir named Geysir? Or will we be swimming amongst the muck and the black tar remembering what it was like to remember the clean air.

Sonnet Two
After Terrence Hayes


The sonnet is love like a skyscraper. I met you 
As the elevator operator/operatic in your verse; the room rose 
On bent and dusted wings. The skyscraper is in love
With stoicism, or solipsism, but either way the scrollwork 
Is romantic and enough to get by on. The briefest prayer for you, 
As the light busts through wooden slats, dove
White. The skyscraper is a mediation on scrollwork, 
Work in meditation on the whiteness of the doves, and so 
You are practice on metitism, industrialism, and sneaking 
Feathers in between lines of poetry. The declaration on metisism: 
“oh Smoke! oh Party!” and before smoke rose like the radio, ten floors straight up, you stepped out for a smoke. The elevator teaches that everything has the capability of rising. 
Where I want to be your worn-out bones look like worn down halos.
________________
San Malo


On Market we were stopped by a harried man, who handed us a pamphlet which read:
“My religion is fog over the prison. Pay your piety to the extradicial force of what a rainbow in the mist does to you!” 
The flier didn’t make much sense, but I must have known that the charisma in the man’s voice was undercut by his rapidly nervous eyes. What connections flurried through my mind then, what an erudite feeling that simple associations provide, for I too spent time in San Malo, and had seen the fog glue itself to my cell’s bars and over the bay in the morning-time. 
“Freedom,” he said to us, “freedom from the inside and permission to exit the confines of one’s own noggin is my religion,” but what he meant was much less about pursuing freedom, but freeing captive, bonding-like chains. Certainly I’ve had to learn again the limitlessness of even the smallest public park, of what freedom looks like in the little waking mornings to the long, cold nights, but moreso what I figured the man meant was that anyone can strive towards freedom––the difficulties come trying to run from the feeling of captivity. The city has grown grey with concrete streets and stony buildings that it feels like San Malo creeps after me.
“What you need to know is that the prison grows. It grows in places you might never expect, and from the outside, we all still look at the same ancient rocks. Internally, sandstone scrapes in the night. Greek marble pillars shoot like the Geysir and just as soon as prison tumbles outwards, so does the lethargic fog give chase.”
These words are the ones which I’ve considered repeatedly, in those liminal spaces: before bed and over the next morning coffee, while in the laundromat watching the drums turn. A prison which grows but still looks the same, I could never understand, and so I came to the conclusion that it must have something to do with the looney mind of the man, birthed from some of that sauce they feed you only on the inside––how could he be talking about anything but prison, which grows constantly––boys being carted in on the daily with the looks on their faces so grotesque, like clay pigeons melting.
I’ve never been good with words. Inside, somehow the idea wormed its way into my brain that I was retarded. This is perhaps based on all the women who’ve drifted into my life just to bundle back up their knapsack once they realize I’m too “brutish” or “stoic” or “retarded”. And so inside I buried my head in books, storming through literature like lightning through air. “I’m dumb,” I said, “I know nothing.” but soon I found that Socrates said the same thing, which wasn’t right. I was dumb and knew nothing, and Socrates was a revered philosopher with a seminar named after him. Thereby, learning that by knowing nothing, I knew the most important thing, I found myself a milkcrate and stood in the depths of 24th on Mission and tried to tell the people passer-bys that too.
Back on the street then, all that was left to do was part ways. But, handing me a second flier same as the first, he patted my hand when I reached for the paper. His hands were rough, back scars like canyons criss crossing his palm. I understood then that the world for the two of us were dissimilar, despite the time we had evidently shared in San Malo. Then me and my posse slipped into the underground. 
When we finally got to the smokey pool hall that was our original destination, I broke the first billiard set in the name of the man we met. Something felt appropriate about the colored balls making their quick ways across the felt, tumbling and crashing into each other, and yet so difficult to sink where they were meant to be. 
I called the first toast to the boys and I and that man’s escape from San Malo, and finally, in a moment I took for myself in the cooling October air, as I took the final drag from the final joint from my shirt pocket, I dedicated that cloud to the infinite extradicial religion of fog over the prison.

Disremember me


When I die, I want an open casket burial
I want my ribs removed by a failing mortician
So my chest can fall during the eulogy


As for my removed ribs, I want them hollowed out
(don’t worry. they will be strong, because i’ve been drinking lots of milk.)
Carve holes in their arc, craft them into flutes, 
Play a song—
Score them once more.

Home Poem


Delirious, not serious, but hot tot full fear of us in the way that when we watched it on TV, it was too late. Slip into something more comfortable, 


these days, those boys wake into writing poems for four to eight hours a day, like they're on a chain smashing rocks for no pointed reason but to forge a river through the great midwest.


In those days, I would wake up, spend the morning writing, eat breakfast on the danube at midday, and then go back to writing. I would go back to sleep, and then do it all again. Who knows where the money came from, or the inspiration, because I had nothing and nobody back then. I didn’t even read.


Back when I was new to the city, I had no friends and no money. There was an apartment off the daube where I spent weeks just writing writing writing all day. I would wake up, take a shower, write. Eat lunch at the cafe at the foot of my building with a yellow pad in hand, scratching. Then write, until in the early evening, I passed out drunk or exhausted or both. There was no time, then, just the poems.


New to the city, I only had poetry. Writing writing writing, the routine woke me up, made me write from the morning to the evening. Years might have passed like that, I’m not too sure.


Suddenly, I was a poet. Years might have passed like this, I’m not sure.
________________
Il Inferno


You’ve left, and the dust has settled around your shoes
        That dust’s arrival, like a witch in a fairy tale, was sudden, and can only mean that soon I will eat that poison apple. I look forward to it.


In your absence, I’ve written more.
        Every day you stay gone, I force out of me another stanza, and today I’ve passed the length of “Il Inferno”
        Dante and I can now stand in the ash and watch the towering blaze properly. Dante, he reminds me of you, funnily enough


There’s a thick round of moldy salami in the fridge icebox. Come home to throw it away.

The new moon and the full moon
                        After eden ahbez
Eden said that “in the evening (when the sky is on fire), Heaven and earth become my great open cathedral.” 
Eden said that “Now, IF YOU MUST FIND FAULT, THIS IS THE WAY TO BEGIN:
 Find me sleeping on a saturday and will you help me understand that there are many kinds of faults and there are many kinds of ways to begin: where the ocean meets the riverwhere you open your eyes underwater and see fish lilt bywhere you lie belly up among something dumb among something golden


and if that still makes no sense and you’re still dumb then:


HE WHO CAN DO THIS HAS THE WHOLE WORLD WITH HIM.
(this is the part where I’d spit on the floor but I’ll refraintoday)        


To stand within the setting sun
        and the star’s shoal is your only conviction
        where all the sky and earth are open to youwhere earth has become my great open cathedral


that’s where I’ll be,
        where I can recognize my seared reflection in the wildfirewhere you can bait the waving shadows into spinning for youwhere you open your eyes underwater and can see the fish lilt bywhere cable knit sweaters dry in front of the firewhere the mangos dry, plums prune, and grapes raisinwhere I lie dumb among something golden


and paint and sing and dance as roots populate the forest soil
        To live in an old lighthouse by the sea
        
too royal at the heart, to give us a laugh through a child's throat.
        To steep among the rye and brush in the sun
        
perhaps in the grass, perhaps in the sun in the midday
        To pull at the well and write at the trees until they fall
and all the gardens have been planted, sown and flourish
the past scrapes its hide along the undergrowth but pay it no mind
        
WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS, TRY THIS:
your ribs are scored along the heavenly lines,
heart cleaved and bloody

Waiting Poem


Unbeknownst, we tumbled out of four-wheel drive


Punch for the bloody knuckles and bruises along your abdomen and torso and punch for the wicked strike cried into your left eye by some other eighteen-year-old guy.


Drunk for the jar of hootch the waitress smartly snuck into the passenger’s seat of our car after we ordered the double tennessee special: two eggs any way, toast, brassy wine, devine!


Pool for the lemon trunks left in the shallow end while you spun and thrashed the fun out of the water in the night, for celebrity waist deep in the deep end of the chlorine.


Lover for what you and I looked like in my head, but then we were skinny dipping the two of us in your pool at two am and it spit pink magical out of my mouth and spit pink into the water. “who couldn’t love shoulders and calves like that!”


My for coughs and street blocks and cries and the first poem I ever wrote about you.

Here’s to the surreal, to a room caulked in darkness save for your phone’s screen. Here’s to the natural history museum at night, to sleeping among the elephant’s exhibit and to waking from a nightmare next to an elephant you can trust. Here’s to curled on your side, spitting up something nectic, green, and swaying, to gum that, piece by piece, crowds your teeth into the metro station. Here’s to spitting the gum up too. Here’s to the marble statues of better men than are made these days. Here’s what airy nights are to city skylines as trees are to lungs are to Paradise. Here’s to the mouse in your house after the storm, to the ants collapsing crumbs and brown crumb cake inwards onto itself. Here’s to cracking open your stomach like an oyster, with chisel and mallet, to finding an indifference of some sort, muted and white among the fat and muscle. Here’s to your phone again, to writing poetry in place of reading poetry in place of writing a poem that goes “hold me up to the light, and you will see that I am not called Caesar for nothing!” Call me blue and watch me shake.

when a long black train rolls into the station
towing a city of passenger cars, sleepers + eaters 
a sandy father steps from the engine and until
this town of onlooking town boys have chewed
Their tobacco and drank their coffee black, magic
Kick of fate pushing them straggling into
a nightmare of existential parables; until
That conductor abandons a black train to wander
around town, thereby then abandoning a roust mass
of sounds and patrons in the cars behind. He
wanders - amongst a staggering light, amongst
cobbled streets and a crew of town boys blue. 
rain rolls off the tender, steaming in darkness
grass wraps the axel, lights go out in a long black train

Comet One


Enter the Great Stag, tall as the pines he strode out of. He was made in the winter, from around the mountain where we couldn’t see, but ever so slowly he made his way towards the town. The churchboy first spotted him from on high the bell tower as he cleaned the bell. He said the tips of the horns looked like teeth sprouting from the forest, and that that’s what tipped him off. From the Hunter’s Union, a team of men were sent to investigate whether or not the beast was a threat. Although the stag was relatively close, the rocky terrain was tough and the men were penchant to wander, and so it took the scouting team three days round trip to report that the stag was, in fact, moving, but at “such an incredibly slow rate that there’s no need to worry.” And so a religion was created amongst the young people of the town, based around the stag and what it would do once it got there. One particularly scrappy devotee wrote a manifesto for their faith, with lines which read: 
enter the great stag, who is divine when the sunlight tumbles through his horns, the cosmos reflected in the ground like baiting shadows, stars scattering like lightning bugs
and
enter the great stag, and hogs follow with him 
who will dig the tubers from the ground and the true heart from the beings who stand opposed
Which made them sound more like a poetry workshop than anything else, and besides this group, since there was a forest of pines in between it and they, the town mostly forgot about the stag. Spring almost passed peacefully. At the end of the season, in those days when summer had crept its way onto the scene, that great stag which the townspeople had forgotten about, made itself known once again. Pines fell out and around the community center as a hoof crushed a ford fiesta that had been parked there. Wild boars streamed out of the thickets and hit the concrete like dogs. Much of the town, given the sabbath nature of the thing, was in a summer jovial mood on the lawn of the church, and so when the stag shaded its way into their town, they rallied behind a bothered feeling which is only so unified in churchtowns such as this. Something had to be done. Out of the community room basement of the church spilled the stag’s devoted followers, running down along the block to where entered the great stag. They carried butcher paper in their hands, on which they began to read their great verse at the foot of the beast
enter the great stag, who’s miraculous beauty is incomprehensible, who holds the answers to death, life, and all questions we need answered
at which time the great stag’s hoof fell like it always had, except one of the revelers was beneath, and its beauty suddenly comprehensible. At this time, the stag’s body was halfway out of the forest, and the churchloungers could see a bird family nesting in the horns. Quick down the street came a fire briggade’s truck, complete with 30 feet of wooden ladder. The truck pulled up on the grass next to the great stag, and an emergency volunteer fire team poured out, climbing up the ladder or grabbing onto the legs of the beast. At the signal of the fire captain, axes were raised, and then brought down. They worked quick to take down the great stag, as the rest of the churchgoers and former revelers watched with mixed emotions but nonetheless silent. The stag as well, seemed indifferent to its fundamental deconstruction, only stopping its forward march with the loss of its legs. The only commotion came when the fighter on the stag’s head called out, once he had hacked through the skull, that the beast’s head was hollow. “No brain!” he called. And before anyone could consider dinner plans, the stag was dead. From the church group, a secondary volunteer team of dads were assembled to hook the new body to their trucks and drag it back into the forest because no one in town wanted to take ownership of the thing. Along the way, one dad wrote on a stray piece of butcher’s paper 
enter the great stag, onto my property, crushing the water tank and tearing away the pines which I so lovingly admired from my back bay window.

(Probably) Guanyin hears:
A dancing jackal. The crack of your lower back as you stand, and the grunting moans of your muscles, as you try and touch your toes. Your body has begun to fight against you, and Guanyin can hear the quiet thunderous snarls of the hound who nips at your heels.


Guanyin, Perceiver of the World, hears:
Winter howling out from within the pines. You’ve planted your feet firm, are ready for the gale, ready for the crux of frost, for every moment of the piercing silence of the dead of winter. In the spring, your milk teeth will litter the ground around the new pine that you’ve become.


Guanyin, Prepared to Exist After Race, hears:
The grumbling of the hot water heater beneath city hall. Above, the walls and floor are made of marble, imbued with the ghosts only natural to bureaucratic sin, but beneath it all, the basement is peaceful. Beautiful dust, swirling lazily, will be all that remains after race.

Poem One


What can you offer me?
Can you suck the toxic things from my wounds?
Your tongue is black, and dusts like charcoal.
You are a lake, and a lake can be many things: a valley of trees 
galley of free dogs carted in special at an exuberant rate,
Trained to sniff out what’s bleeding from your lakes.
I have given my life to the struggle,
How will you say the same?

Comet Two


I lie here morose, bones splintering like branches and thundering around. There’s left the deep touch of the sacred thing called autumn, and for me, autumn is all that stands between my ancient cadaver and the winter. I’d stand, if I could, for you, but instead I sleep in short bursts, living through what was and what wasn’t and in the end, I’ve learned to release regrets like I always hoped I would. Like bleach, the oils thundering out from my joints corrode away the grass and the rocky topsoil and the dirt below my ribs. Without simple sediments and without regrets of what my life was and wasn’t there was nothing stopping my descent into the true soil, so that I might feed the autumn for a while longer and together we are a threat. The leaves rustle in the trees and say “live to love now before the last wax drips and drizzles. Love the mist and love the body in which enters a type of autumn.”

Dear Winter,


I’ve run out of tricks now. This is how I’ve found myself at your door. I used to tell myself that this day would never come, when I would be forced into your tender chill, but look at me now.


Maybe I thought I was too intelligent, that I might outsmart you, winter. In grief (and this is not to say I’m in grief), the sign that the mind is ready to move on is to pay attention to the pronouns the person uses. A woman is left widowed, and she speaks of “I,” wherein “what could I have done differently,” or even “I don’t want to eat,” “I think about nothing but him.” She is grieving. Look at Plath, whose poetry was ripe with that “I,” notorious then again for the way she went out. And so winter, I’ve become obsessed with the “I”. I’ve become obsessed with the overcoming of the “I,” that now that I know, I can be stronger than it. 


That’s all for now, because I’ve run out of words to tell you. Perhaps I’ll write again.

We are content to stain our first 
teeth on fags and clementines, if it means 
they’ll drop out sooner, As the new 
teeth creep in, we gather in pine’s 
roasting forest and talk about 
all the dreams of what our new teeth might become.
the second time, we’re 
not quite so hasty. To knock them 
black is a molotov cocktail in the hands of Statue of Liberty.

Comet Three


Winter comes in droves this year, like the locust. On the radio, in statistics like “it’s the coldest day in the past thirty years,” and “the coldest year in recorded history.” You awake from an elkskin and find there’s no more layers to wrap yourself in. You pluck birds from the river, stonefrozen, and there, the butterflies and bees are like gravel, shivering on the ground. The wind whispers “winter is a threat. Winter is an end to the means of no one good, the hollowing force of collective conscious god freed from the cracks.” You twist and twirl in the new snow.

Poem Three


Over a mountain like a maze, like lines of man-made trails, I came to the valley. In which, I wrung my clothes out to dry. In which, eucalyptus groves sampled themselves as though they were plaqued up in a museum to say “crow grove”. In which every trail around poured away from the valley. In which we were lost for ourselves, to which I said “this is our new place to live.” 


Reasons to leave were like twins, dreaming and crying with the same nose, same eyes. Where do I belong? I asked. What is mine?


Among the dirt and green creepers I found a 50 cent bucket filled with brackish, mossy water. I was frustrated—too close to a reminder of what I was running from. It was never warm enough in those days.


You’ve always been tempered 
Towards the lip of the world
Where it’s just winter

        Her name for him was ‘The Golden Son,” of which the pun was lost on her. His name for himself, in those long, incense hours, was “One Who Stacks Ginger,” of which the humor was also lost on her. “I have given you the most honorable job,” she would say, “because you are in charge of all the things we sell which bring youth.” The youth who brings the youth, thought Oscar, but he refrained himself.
        These days, all the boy was made up of was refrains––refrains from spending all day at the Danube Cafe drinking chai lattes, refrains from staring too long at the daughters who came in, refrains from rolling up with Jonah in a Golden Gate bush. And so all that was left was waiting for just one more hour to pass in the day, which was a pretty grim way to live. Time passed like this.
        The shop was white, almost like a laboratory, if the ceilings were lower. Oftentimes, when the day was slow, Oscar would sit in the back and squint out into the impossibly white room. The yellow of the Saint John’s Wort would mix with the burgundy pomegranates, with the colors in the jars of the rest of the room, and a shifting painting would make itself known. Oscar could then tilt his head, and the world would kaleidoscopically reconfigure itself into another shape. Oscar would spend hours shaking his head up and down and around, until his mother called him to carry in another box of dried chamomile, and wickedly he stepped forward into the world he created. He would feel then like what a cartoon character must feel like. Time passed like this.
        White women would sometimes come into the shop, who frequented obtuse parts of the internet or had Chinese husbands. They only bought the pre-boxed pills, full of chrysanthemums and chamomile flowers, and so they were Oscars’ job. He checked them out and wrote things like take three, three times a day while the women looked around with puppy-dog eyes at glass jars full of smells they would never experience.

Boy’s County


Where I hang hangs my friend, Joey Clean, named so for the hours and hours he spent out bathing in the river. Only later did he tell me (once he figured I was cool with homosexuality and all), that he had met a boy who could hold his breath for sixty seconds or more underwater, which he did whenever Clyde, who owned that river, came around with his pail.
There was never a chance for either of us, I don’t think, but that’s coming from someone already hanging in their gallows; someone who’s already trudged through their bleeding rut and bleeding their life out through the holes poked in their toes. Cleanie, hanging here, doomed himself when he finally got up the nerve to ask his little boy-toy his real name. That riverboy wouldn’t give it up––not until Joey invoked the Boy’s County tradition of extra tough love. So then it was Joey Cleanie who carried in his arms the waterlogged first born son of the Count of Trieste and carried on his shoulders a head that was hanged 10 hours later.
This was Boy’s County, land of shirtless shorts and belts––hot summer days and gruff howdy “heys” and, unfortunate for myself and Joey Cleanie, land of persecution by nightfall. There’s no subtlety in Boy’s County, and what passes for empathy is really just tough love knuckles to the head and slaps on the ass.
To speak of tough love is still to speak of exceptions and exceptional Daniel Rocks and Machete Branch, wrestlers in every right given. To even look at the big gangly pair was to wonder, who am I in this shadow, and yet the two, since they began to tussle in back fields and church basements, were only matched for themselves. As the raindrop does not battle the mountain, Danny-Boy and his Machete weathered the gales and summer mists of Boy’s County, until finally an autumnal typhoon washed them down the river. Blue faced boys, red welts ringed around their necks, white nails, shriveled but still clean.
Leading up to the strung noose ‘round my neck was less the circular life that most boys of Boy’s County and boys across my America get, because as the boy of the sole mortician in town, life becomes more like a straight line to death no matter how many laurel gold wreaths you hang upon its neck. And yet, what so attracted me to the morticionary was the freedom wherewithal it provided me into the beautiful grey folds and dry sinews and glassy eyes of the gentle cadaver. Like the arborealist paints the birds of paradise, so does the mortician’s apprentice sketch the bend of the legs of the newest clients––but it was no thigh which had me hanged, but instead the more luminous, fragile parts of the masculinity which they found inside.

You spent your last dime on coca cola
Under the notion that it might be sleaze 
But the gut says no to the cold soda
Ham’ring down the PCH, the speed 
Never going past a hundred, say, born 
The orange sunset. Goad and whistle “Who’s
better than us?” tattooed in silver on
The bumper. Small change in glove compartment.
And when it ran out, that’s the time to get
a new car. The rubber band never breaks,
But when it does, everyone breathes in. Now
Gas tank flickers red oil flown out front.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks 
Last dime! Your high speed rubber band heart, aches.

Two deer stand within the garden fence, nibbling. They
Dig amongst the tubers with their hooves, hoping to find something to eat.
In November, all we had left were beans
And what we could grow in the garden, beats mostly,
The cold had eaten what grew above the ground. “This
Isn’t so bad,” you said, eating soup off an old
Wooden spoon. The deer looked gangly and yellow,
A weathered pair.


The wooded walls creaked at dinner.
Really the whole house rumbled, as if to say this is
It. The radio rambled in the corner a sound from a 
Lonelier time, but we both agreed what we’ve got is a casual
Affair.


Once, up the road came a plain
Gentleman, hair like ivory chipware
And as we watched him from the window go by on 
High, you said, “looks to me two a
Us don’t need to be cooped up plain
Watching the deers and the gentlemen walk by, and
Maybe this life couldn’t be so bad.” But hope was creaking,
And all that surrounded our home was a path and a wood.


You, who played music on the cacophonous tin
Me, who watched the roads and put up the flatware


Two deer step amongst the garden fence, two
Feet taller than it was before. Deer who
Scrape the icy dirt, and all they have left are
Beets from the garden, Mostly
Good.

Dear Miles Davis,
In the name of looking at life, I’m writing this letter to you, the dead Miles Davis because somehow Sketches of Spain changed me. I’d like to use this space to hopefully explore how.


Dear Miles Davis:
I bought a spanish guitar in order to play spanish jazz, which isn’t really spanish but instead some coincidence of sounds that came out of your trumpet one smokey afternoon. I listen and love and think “What now?” and so I too take ownership of your sketches. In that same way you are, I too, am Spanish.
These days, I don’t care to put on the Chick Corea record at the party, but more and more does the loose shape of jazz usher its way uninvited through my life. I see it in the light falling in the stoplight, and in the invisible winds which whip through the tallgrass, and in how the wine clings to the glasses as I try to wash it away. Swaying is inherently jazzy. When everyone else has trundled home for the night I’ve taken up to putting on Concierto de Aranjuez and trying my hand at plucking along. It’s nice to take this time for the two of us, just chatting.


Dear Miles Davis,
I haven’t written anything besides the asides in the checkbooks in awhile, and I haven’t written a letter in even longer–since my father died, at least. He lived on the coast, and used to stamp the letters with the wine cork. Since I lost that smell, it’s been difficult to find any real use of letters–I’ve written one eulogy already. And yet, you’re dead, so how come I want to write to you and only to you?


Dear Miles Davis,
Bulls graze in the pasture atop fire mountain, chanting and spinning, spinning and chanting their vitriolic motto, “if you die great, then you’re doing good.” Is that jazz? My motto is “to know you’re alive, look at life.”
When I play your record for the cattle, they sway jazzily along with the horns, and I suspect they may be lonesome in their memory of home. It’s a silly sight, to be sure. All they know in their body is the dirt below them, and the grasses which regrow only to be eaten, but then I could say that the bulls are a part of the land by virtue of their natural culling, threshers in the yellowing grass that at sunset they warble. 


Dear Miles Davis,
I sold one of my boys today, to a breeder from the west. I met the man when he drove up my road in his flatbed, towing a cattle hauler, and I met the man again when he shook my hand and promised he wouldn’t use my bull for the county fights. That was always the fear, dangling around the farm, off the horns and stake posts. I asked the man inside for some milk and coffee, but he pointed to his flatbed and said he came prepared, whatever that meant. As I write this, the boys sleep peacefully, the rumbling of their snores indistinguishable from the last night, but I know that it’s one less. And so, I returned to you.


Dear Miles Davis,
If Toledo is knife country and Salamanca is stone country, then you, Davis, are horn country; where else can I experience such casual ascension? 
My father was born in Flamenco country, in the south of Spain, and moved late in his life. He resented the change, the harsh winters, and the land which seemed too vindictive to be on the same planet. I never knew Spain, but as he described it he grew as tender as I have ever seen him, and so I too, fell in love. Why not? I feel as though your record gives me a purpose, sketches reasoning into why I held onto a love of that place which I had never visited before. 


Dear Miles Davis,
One of the bulls escaped the paddock in the night. Somehow, he gained great strength and leapt the wooden fence onto the other side, trampled around threshed weeds and dry grass, barreling up and over the first horizon to the north, making his new path as he stumbled. 
The rest of the bulls, they tangled within each other like bees in the sky all night and that’s how I knew that a bull was missing. I followed the trail easily, and came upon my boy over the hill in the dry creek bed sat on a broken leg. He recognized me as I approached, and we both recognized what sort of situation this was. There was no way for me to move that body, and he couldn’t move himself, and so we were helpless. The sun rose around us, and even if I could manage to fix up my bull, there would be no way for me to move his body. This was the end of the line. 
I wonder if this is what he wanted when he escaped––to end up fly food and bones in a bone dry river. I could never answer that question, but what I did do was name the boy Solea and write a solea in his honor, because I believe that everyone should have some art made of them before they die, in order to guarantee that they live on. Here’s what I wrote:
        
Solea for the Bull


Honey drips
Away the 
Quiet night


Are your eyes
golden
Like they say?
Or are they sweet


I loved you
Your hills which
Roamed 


Made sweet and 
Yellow too soon
My boy


Is this jazz? There’s no life to look at here, and so I’m helpless. I’d admit that to no one else. As I write this, the bull still sits out in the field, with a written poem run through his horns. I hope he’s asleep now, because I’ve decided that, while I could bring him food and water in that northern little creek bed, as I walked into the house I felt the first gust of winter, and I can’t leave him in the cold.

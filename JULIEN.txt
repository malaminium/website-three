I’d like to be on a beach right now. Or, Max Chu would rather be on a beach right now. It’s really all he thinks about—not, em dashes, not proper biography conjugation, not international states’ relations, nothin’. Instead he’s in San Francisco (born and raised), writing poetry. It’s the next best thing; beaches, one, then poetry, two. Now writing poetry on a beach? Oh boy.

During the Life and Time of Julien Caesar While He Was Still Steeping in Nausea

LETTER


Dear Julien Caesar,
        I have decided to name my poetry collection after you. It’ll be “During the Life and Times of Julien Caesar While He Was Still Steeping in Nausea,” which I know is a bit lengthy, but I’m not at all ashamed as I have a reputation to uphold. 
        Let me tell you about the poems! They’ll be introspections on you, Julien! They’ll inspect your loves, your obsessions, your addictions through grey and blue, through natural and metropolitan relations, and through the sea, of course. You’ll think this crude, a visceral mask that I’ve hidden behind to merely express myself, but you must understand that I only write about things I love, and one of them is you! I hope to be alliterative in the telling of your life, for I wish to mimic sea shanties, copy childrens songs, and replicate an old tune all in one.
        You were of the sea, I believe. I remember that you were born in New York, but travelled everywhere on those big brassy oil riggers. I was envious when I was first told the tale that is your life––you spit in every port along the Atlantic, and pissed in double as many! Every Pacific sailor shanties your praises and every Caribbean turtle knows you by at most three degrees of separation and in that same way, I’ll do my best to do you well, Julien.
        Something I must admit to you is that the collection is not complete. Far from it, in fact! There are so many things I need—so many things I hate about the collection before it’s even been born—that this letter might not even reach your hands! Maybe by the time you read this, it’ll all be for naught and I will have published the collection under the name “Maybelline Stronghardt’s Family Cookbook” and I will drink about it in the cobbled streets of Tuscany. In the offseason. In the rain. Doesn’t that sound depressing! But Julien, I will try and do right by you, even if I have to change the name of the collection—which has brought me to the three psychologists and one scientist I call my analytical side—and together, me, myself, and those guys have restrained what I might still improve into three working topics:
 Firstly, we need more narration! I need your story told so that my hands can be clean of it and my chest be lighter. I need more narration because I heard a story about a refrigerator and I got jealous so now Julien Caesar must now be synonymous with a happy suicide as well. Sorry about that.
Secondly, we need more audience relevance! Why does it matter if you’re introspective when no one can see your insides? Let’s flay you out like everyone else; so we smoked! So we were pandering for something more like hay in a flaming cart.
Finally, for myself and not you, we need more of your metropolitan side. Come sit with me someday—there’s a new cafe around the block that has the best croissants in the city. I can finally tell you what those ribs mean and finally tell what color your eyes really are, and whether your voice is like an ocean wave because there’s little tide pools in your lungs, or if that’s the way your mother was. You can finally tell me about yourself. 
We’re stateless, baseless, you and I, and though I’m fickle, I’ll try and do right by you.


All The Best,
Your friend

JULIEN CAESAR IS:
“IN TOO DEEP”


Here’s to the surreal, to a room caulked in darkness save for your phone’s screen. Here’s to the natural history museum at night, to sleeping among the elephant’s exhibit and to waking from a nightmare next to an elephant you can trust. Here’s to curled on your side, spitting up something nectic, green, and swaying; to gum that, piece by piece, crowds your teeth into the metro station. Here’s to spitting the gum up too. Here’s to the marble statues of better men than are made these days. Here’s what airy nights are to city skylines as trees are to what lungs look like in Paradise. Here’s to those who look at Paradise’s lungs, too. Here’s to the mouse in your house after the storm, to the ants collapsing crumbs and brown crumb cake inwards onto itself. Here’s to cracking open your stomach like an oyster, with chisel and mallet, to finding an indifference of some sort, muted and white among the fat and muscle. Here’s to your phone again, to writing poetry in place of reading poetry in place of writing a poem that goes “hold me up to the light, and you will see that I am not called Caesar for nothing!” Call me blue and here’s to it!

DIS(RE)MEMBER ME


When I die, I want an open casket burial
I want my ribs removed by a failing mortician
So my chest can fall during the eulogy.


As for my removed ribs, I want them hollowed out
(don’t worry. they will be strong, because i’ve been drinking lots of milk.)
Carve holes in their arc, craft them into flutes, 
Play a song—
Score them once more.

BOY LOVER


Boy lover, where do you fall
               where do you wade?
Boy lover, does the cement get to you
               does the sentimentality ever get the best of you?
Boy lover, when you go to Ocean Beach at 8pm
              and strip to the nude
              when one foot drags the other
              raw in the sand’s grain
              when your fingers turn blue,
        Know that to feel love is to feel warmth in your body
                                                     in your antibodies boldy fighting a cold
        So wade in the icy tide, boy lover,
              Drowning in the cold and dipping in the blue


Boy lover, as though saturn has supercollided in your eyes, you’re blind to
             who loves you most but your very own blood in your body
                That’s why you bite the city mouse in two,
                score its ribs with your teeth and swallow its lungs
                that’s why you wade in the icy tide, lover
Boy lover, where are you lost
             where too are you scored?
Boy lover, how is it, when you gargle the ocean in your lungs, that you care to speak still
             how jellyfish float in your throat and barnacles sprout from your cracked lips


Boy lover, what loves you standing nude in the mirror,
     robbed, red, dirty lunged and voice like an avalanche
Boy lover, where your hair’s slicked back and dripping
             where your belly is lumped and rancid and boundless at once
             where your nails are yellow and perfectly, geometrically, twisting
             where your cheeks are two blue bruises


        And suddenly, you’re Gothic, boy lover
________________
UNBEKNOWNST, WE TUMBLED OUT OF FOUR WHEEL DRIVE


Punch for the bloody knuckles and bruises along your abdomen and torso and punch for the wicked strike cried into your left eye by some other eighteen-year-old guy.


Drunk for the jar of hootch the waitress smartly snuck into the passenger’s seat of our car after we ordered the double tennessee special: two eggs any way, toast, brassy wine, divine!


Pool for the lemon trunks left in the shallow end while you spun and thrashed the fun out of the water in the night, for celebrity waist deep in the deep end of the chlorine.


Lover for what you and I looked like in my head, but then we were skinny dipping the two of us in your pool at two am and it spit pink magical out of my mouth and spit pink into the water. “who couldn’t love shoulders and calves like that!”


My for coughs and street blocks and cries and the first poem I ever wrote about you.

Julien says there’s no need to worry;
when November ends, there’s always December.
Henri dropped off in a frightened hurry,
but Julien says there’s no need to worry.
When dogs die, they’re burned or buried
and by urn or stone, we will remember.
Julien says there’s no need to worry.
When November ends, there’s always December.

The toxidromes drone on and
        on until the story finally comes to:
                “no more liver for you!
                  you drank too much, so
                  try water next time.”

HE IS SANDMAN, ISN’T HE?


So he sieved sleeveless, so 
the sleeves seized in the sieve’s 
serrated teeth


So what he played in the muck
and ducked
the collars of the basketballers once
or twice 
Be nice, and call him when he falls,


cut laces laced the holes of his
steel wool shoes,
feet bloody like steaks
soles like chiseled from mallet


So he sieved sleeveless, so what?
So boys brought him artichokes on 
Valentines day, and dates
on pizza, white cheese, zucchini flowers… 






Wrist-deep in the earth he sieved. The packed earth’s
packed ice scored red rings around his knuckles;
perfect solar-icicle sieve circles 
and I’m told to say this plain and careful so here it is:
        “New York may be where he worked, but
        his head was on mercury and that’s all
        there is to say about that!”
So what his head went head first out the hearse
Post mortem depression and 
his sleeves caught on the door and suddenly his arms were strung up,
as though surrendered.
        That’s so fucked up!
softer now:
         That’s so fucked up. So what? He sieved sleeveless.
                                                       sleeveless to see the bone.

“and in the evening (when the sky is on fire), Heaven and earth become my great open cathedral.” -eden ahbez, full moon


HE WHO CAN DO THIS HAS THE WHOLE WORLD WITH HIM
        TO stand within the setting sun
        where the sea submits to a heavenly combustion
        where all the sky and earth are open to you
        and the star’s shoal is your only conviction


IF YOU MUST FIND FAULT, THIS IS THE WAY TO BEGIN
        TO wade in the clouds, to stroll along the seafloor and swim in the forest
        where you can recognize your heavenly reflection in the wild
where you can bait the waving shadows into spinning for you 
and paint and sing and dance as roots populate the forest soil


THE MOVIES DO IT. TV DOES IT….WHY DON’T YOU DO IT
        TO live in an old lighthouse by the sea
        where you open your eyes underwater just to see the fish lilt by
where cable knit sweaters dry in front of the fire
too royal at the heart, to give us a laugh through a child's throat.


HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU INSTANTLY
        TO steep among the rye and brush in the sun
        where the mangos dry, plums prune, and grapes raisin
where you lie quiet; among something golden
perhaps in the grass, perhaps in the sun in the midday


IF YOU WANT TO GATHER HONEY, DON’T KICK OVER THE BEEHIVE
        TO pull at the well and write at the trees until they fall
where all dogs have good names
and all the gardens have been planted, sown, and flourished
the past scrapes its hide along the undergrowth but pay it no mind
        
WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS, TRY THIS
        AND in the evening, when the sky aligns again and
 your ribs are scored along the heavenly lines,
heart cleaved and bloody, then you will be
forgiven by dirt for your character crime
